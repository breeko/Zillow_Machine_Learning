Everything from the square rooms, to the herring bone basket-weave floor, to the dining alcove projects the refined serenity that makes classic prewar buildings so charming and comfortable. ..The entry foyer has two closets and distributes to the living room to the right and the dining alcove and kitchen straight ahead. The bedroom is accessed from the living room and has a corner northwest exposure, with three windows. Two more closets in the bedroom provide for ample storage space within this home.
